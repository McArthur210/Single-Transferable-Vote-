# Single-Transferable-Vote-
# Simulates an election under Single Transferable Vote using the Gregory Method to distribute surplus votes, Droop as the quota, and backwards tie-breaking. 
# Put a comma inbetween the names of your candidates in your list of candidates
# Example: Jack Jones, Joe Rogan, Mary Sue, Johnny Test 

# Backawrds tie-breaking is when two or more candidates are tied and you look to the previous round to see who has the least (or most) amount of votes to determine a loser (or winner). If the tied candidates are tied again in the previous round, then try the next previous round until you reach the first. At that point you randomly choose who the loser (or winner) is.
